Boolean feature of personal pronouns or determiners. It tells whether the word is reflexive, i.e. refers to the subject of its clause.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not reflexive, the
`Reflex` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT`
column. (Which means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

These words are reflexive in Pashto:
* personal pronoun ځان <i>żân</i> (indeclinable)
* personal possessive determiner خپل <i>xpël</i> (declined like common adjectives in agreement with the possessed object)
