Boolean feature of personal pronouns or determiners. It tells whether the word is possessive.

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the
`Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the `FEAT` column. (Which
means that empty value has the `No` meaning.)

These words are possessive in Pashto:
* personal reflexive determiner خپل <i>xpël</i>
* weak personal pronouns (مې <i>me</i>, دې <i>de</i>, يې <i>ye</i>, مو <i>mu</i>) may denote unstressed possession (but they can express take also other fucntions in the sentence)

The possession can be also marked by genitive forms of personal pronouns, however, they are <b>NOT</b> tagged as possessive.
