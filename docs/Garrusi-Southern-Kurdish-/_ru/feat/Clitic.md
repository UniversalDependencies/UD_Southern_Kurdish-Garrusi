This is a binary (yes/no) feature that is only annotated when its value is `Yes`. 

In Modern Russian, it is used for unstressed shortened forms of personal pronouns in oblique cases, mostly _те_ (Dative) and _тя_ (Genitive or Accusative).  

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is clitic

#### Examples

* _я <b>те</b> дам!_ “I will hit you!”, lit. “I <b>to-you</b> will-give!”
