### Definition

Auxiliary verbs (AUX), which add functional and grammatical meaning to the sentence, expressing tense, aspect, mood, etc., can be of two types: (a) those which accompany the nominal paradigm and, (b) those which accompany the verbal paradigm. In both cases, _auxiliaries_ can act either as clitics or as separate words. Verb forms that can be syntactically independent of a host while attaching to its stem include the first, second and third-person forms of the auxiliary verb ‘to be’.
