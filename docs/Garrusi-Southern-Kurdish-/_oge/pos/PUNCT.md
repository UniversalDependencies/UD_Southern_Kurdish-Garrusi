### Definition

In Old Georgian manuscripts, punctuation symbols were rarely used. Depending on the context, the ჻ mark served to separate words, sentences, and sometimes even paragraphs. However, printed editions of these manuscripts typically follow the punctuation conventions of Modern Georgian. Notably, punctuation marks are not separated from the words they accompany—even in hyphenated compounds such as არა-საჴმარი (ara-sax̣mari, ‘unusable’) or დიდ-დიდი (did-didi, ‘big-big’)—which are treated as single tokens. An exception to this rule is the dash, which is separated from the surrounding characters. Additionally, punctuation marks may appear in sequences, such as a question mark followed by an exclamation mark (?!), an exclamation mark followed by two full stops (!..), or an ellipsis (…).
