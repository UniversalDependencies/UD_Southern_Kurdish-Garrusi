### Definition

The tag X is used for words that, for various reasons, cannot be assigned a specific part-of-speech category. In Old Georgian, this tag is applied to foreign words whose grammatical structure cannot be analyzed, particularly when the dependency relation is marked as foreign, as well as to words with diacritics that are unreadable or unclear. 

This usage does not extend to ordinary loan words where it is assigned a normal part-of-speech.
