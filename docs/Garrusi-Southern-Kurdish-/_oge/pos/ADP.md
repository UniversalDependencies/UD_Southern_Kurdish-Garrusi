### Definition

Adposition is a cover term for postpositions. In Old Georgian, there are only [postpositions](_oge/feat/AdpType).

In Old Georgian, postpositions can appear as suffixes attached to inflected nominals (nouns, adjectives, numerals, and pronouns), as separate words, or even in prepositional as well as postpositional positions. Each postposition governs a specific grammatical case. When a postposition is attached to a nominal, it determines the case of that nominal. Notably, no postpositions govern the ergative or vocative cases. The status of postpositions as multi-word tokens is accounted for at the level of syntactic annotation.
