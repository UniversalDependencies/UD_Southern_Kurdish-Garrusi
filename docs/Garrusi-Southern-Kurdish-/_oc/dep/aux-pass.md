A passive auxiliary of a clause is a non-main verb of the clause which contains the passive information.
In the Old Gascon corpus **UD_Occitan-CorAG**, only the verb _eser_ (modern Occitan _èsser_) can have this function.


Some examples from **UD_Occitan-CorAG**:

~~~ sdparse
quar lo pay es thiencut de pagar son delicte \n because the father is obliged to pay for his crime
aux:pass(thiencut, es)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
Item, ni a ost sino ayssicum dessus es escruit \n nor (to give) army as it is described above
aux:pass(escruit, es)
~~~

~~~ sdparse
et era deyt que ed sabia melhs las costumas de la terra \and it was said that he knew better the customs of the land
aux:pass(deyt, era)
