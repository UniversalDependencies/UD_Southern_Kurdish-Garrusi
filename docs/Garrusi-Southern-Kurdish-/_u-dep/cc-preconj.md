A preconjunct is the relation between the head of coordination and the word that appears at the
beginning of the coordination (which could be seen as the first part of a multi-word coordinating
conjunction). English examples include _<b>either</b> ... or_, _<b>neither</b> ... nor_,
_<b>both</b> ... and_.
