### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](_xmf/pos/VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. In Megrelian, they may also modify [adjectives](_xmf/pos/ADJ) (as in _<b>ძან//ძაან</b> სკვამ (d͡zɑn//d͡zɑɑn skʼvɑm)_ "very beautiful"), other adverbs (as in _<b>ძან//ძაან</b> მანგარ (d͡zɑn//d͡zɑɑn</b> mɑnɡɑr)_ "very well"). There are eight different types of adverbs in Georgian: local (AdvType=Loc), temporal (AdvType=Tim), modifier (AdvType=Man), degree (AdvType=Deg), causal (AdvType=Cau), purpose adverb (AdvType=Pur), interrogative (AdvType=Int), and directional (AdvType=Dir). Generally, adverbs can be considered a closed class of items which can be expanded with two slots, namely a slot for postpositions and for indirect speech markers, but in Georgian, adverbs often have particles added to them, indicating their type, see [PartType](_xmf/feat/PartType).
