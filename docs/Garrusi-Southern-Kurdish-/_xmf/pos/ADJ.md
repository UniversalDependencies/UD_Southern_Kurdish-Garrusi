### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. There are no restrictions on the use of adjectives preceding or following the noun, prepositive placement is more frequent in Megrelian. Megrelian adjectives can also be inflected for degree of comparison, forming comparative, superlative, and equative forms to express relative, highest, or equal intensity of a property.

Adjectives in Megrelian normally agree in Number and Case with the noun they modify (both preceding or following nouns).
