The `Voice` feature applies to [VERB](_xm/pos/VERB).

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active and autoactive voices

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object is affected by the action (patient). This label is also used for the autoactive voice, when the subject of the verb is the agent and the patient of the action.

#### Examples

* _ცხოვრენს თინა, იცხოვრენს თინა, იცხოვრუ (t͡sxɔvrɛns tinɑ, it͡sxɔvrɛns tinɑ, it͡sxɔvru)_ 'he/she lives, he/she makes himself/herself live, he/she lived'

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer (agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an oblique dependent or an object of the verb. 

#### Examples

* _ოჭარუუ(ნ), აჭარუუ(ნ) (ɔt͡ʃʼɑruu(n), ɑt͡ʃʼɑruu(n))_'he/she makes to be written, he/she gets written'
