The `Mood` feature applies to [VERB](_xmf/pos/VERB).

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative can be considered the default mood. A verb in indicative merely states that something happens, has happened or will happen, without adding any attitude to the speaker.

#### Examples

* _ზიმუნს (zimuns)_ 'he/she measures', _სქირუნს (skiruns)_ 'he/she dries' etc.

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive

The subjunctive mood is used for actions that are subjective or otherwise uncertain.

#### Examples

* _ზიმუნდას (zimundɑs)_ 'he/she was measuring', _სქირუდას (skirudɑs)_ 'he/she was drying' etc.

### <a name="Cnd">`Cnd`</a>: conditional

The conditional mood is used to express actions that would have taken place under some circumstances but they actually did not / do not happen.

#### Examples

* _ზიმუნდ(უ)კო(ნი) (zimund(u)kʼɔ(ni))_ 'so that he/she would measure', _სქირუდ(უ)კო(ნი) (skirud(u)kʼɔ(ni))_ 'so that it would dry' etc.

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The imperative mood is used to express commands, requests, advice, or instructions directed to the listener.

#### Examples
* _დოჭარას//ნ (dɔt͡ʃʼɑrɑs//n)_ 'Write', _ნიჭარუნქ (nit͡ʃʼɑrunk)_ 'Don't write' etc.
