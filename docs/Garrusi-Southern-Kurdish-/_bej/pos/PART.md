### Definition

Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech.
We process as PART some affixes and clitics: adverbializers, case markers, deictics and emphatics.

### Examples :
- _han_ (focalisation particle)
- _ontʔa_ "now" (discourse particle)
- _ajwa_ "yes"
