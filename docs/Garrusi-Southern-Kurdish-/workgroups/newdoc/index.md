Note: This page was started as an incubator for the construction-oriented documentation of the UD guidelines.
It was started by Dan and Joakim during Dan's visit in Uppsala in 2018. The list on this index page indicates
topics that we thought would have to be covered. Only a few of the pages were written before the effort got
stalled, though. On the other hand, some of the newly written pages have been approved and elevated to the
main guidelines. In such cases the links from this index should lead up to the main guidelines.

# Construction-Oriented Documentation

* [Simple verbal clauses](simple_verbal_clauses.html) (intransitive, transitive; core vs. oblique arguments)
* [Simple noun phrases](simple_noun_phrases.html)
  * [Two nominals](two_nominals.html)
* Modifiers (obliques and adverbials; adjectives; adverbs modifying nouns; modifiers modifying other modifiers)
* Coordination (of simple noun phrases or simple clauses; difference from parataxis?)
* More about simple clauses
  * [Intransitive and zero-transitive clauses](intransitive_clauses.html) (intransitive clauses with obligatory oblique arguments, split intransitivity, zero transitivity with a link to expletives, the “dative subject” issue)
  * [Ditransitive clauses](ditransitive_clauses.html)
  * [Valency-changing operations](valency_changing_operations.html) (passive, antipassive, causative, applicative)
  * Expletives, multiple realizations of arguments
  * Nonprototypical clauses
    * [Clauses with object predication](object_predication.html)
