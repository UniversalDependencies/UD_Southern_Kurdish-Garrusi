This is used for [interjections](naq-pos/INTJ) and other elements (which are not clearly linked to the structure of the sentence, except in an expressive way). This includes: interjections (_oh_, _ae_, _î_ "yes"), fillers (_uh_, _ahah_), backchannels (_mhm_, _ehe_), false starts and non-adverbial discourse markers (_ok_, _so_). These discourse elements are attached to the head of the most relevant nearby unit, often a clause.
