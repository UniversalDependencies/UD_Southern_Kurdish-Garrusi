An open clausal complement (`xcomp`) of a verb or an adjective is (i) a core argument of the verb, (ii) which is without its own subject and (iii) for which the reference of the subject is necessarily determined by an argument external to the `xcomp`. The third requirement is often referred to as obligatory control. An `xcomp` can also be described as a predicative complement.
