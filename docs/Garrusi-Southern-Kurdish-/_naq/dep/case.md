The `case` relation in Khoekhoe is used for any case-marking element which is treated as a separate syntactic word (mostly postpositions). Case-marking elements are treated as dependents of the noun they attach to or introduce.

Note, quotative _ti_, when it is used for labels, and possessive _di_ are analysed as case markers.
