### Definition

Determiners (or pro-adjectives) are words that modify [nouns](naq-pos/NOUN) or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc.

`DET` tag includes (pronominal) quantifiers (words like _ǂgui_ "many", _ǀoro_ "few"). Total determiner _hoa_ "all" may follow a nominal it modifies (rather then precede it as usually). In this case it has the same [Person](naq-feat/Person), [Gender](naq-feat/Gender), [Number](naq-feat/Number), and [Assoc](naq-feat/Assoc) as the nominal, and gets the [Case](naq-feat/Case) of the whole noun phrase. It also can be used as a part of discontinuous fixed multiword determiner _mâ ... hoa_: _hoa xūn, hoa xūna, (mâ) xūn hoan, (mâ) xūn hoana_.

However, cardinal numerals in the narrow sense (_ǀgui, ǀgam, ǃnona_ "one, two three") are not tagged `DET`, but rather [NUM](naq-pos/NUM).

In most cases, Khoekhoe determiners do not have person-gender-number suffixes and precede a nominal (the same is true about [adjectives](naq-pos/ADJ)), whereas [pronouns](naq-pos/PRON)) have  person-gender-number suffix suffixes.

Two possessive markers, _ti_ "my" and _sa_ "your (sing.)", are tagged as `DET`, since they modify nominals and do not inflect (which is similar to [adjectives](naq-pos/ADJ).

### Examples

* possessive determiners (which modify a nominal): _ti_ "my", _sa_ "your (sing.)"

* demonstrative determiners: _nē_ "this", _ǁnā_ "that", _nau_ "that (the other one)"

* interrogative determiners: _mâ_ "which"

* total determiners: _mâ_, _hoa_ "all"

* indefinite quantifiers: _ǂgui_ "many", _ǀoro_ "few"

* negative determiners: _xare_ "none, no" (in apposition with nouns)

* emphatic determiner: _ǂû_ "-self" (in apposition with nominals)
