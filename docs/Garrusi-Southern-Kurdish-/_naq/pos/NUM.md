### Definition

A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction.

Note that cardinal numerals are covered by `NUM` whether they are used as determiners or not (as in _ǀgawi daob khoeseǀab_ "Highway Nineteen") and whether they are expressed as words (haka), digits (4) or Roman numerals (IV). Other words functioning as determiners (including quantifiers such _hoa_ "all") are tagged [DET](naq-pos/DET).

There are words that may be called numerals in Khoekhoe, but which are not tagged NUM. Such non-cardinal numerals belong to other parts of speech in our universal tagging scheme, based mainly on syntactic criteria: ordinal numerals are [adjectives](naq-pos/ADJ) (_ǂguro_ "first") or [adverbs](naq-pos/ADV) (_ǂgūrose_ "at first"), multiplicative numerals are [adverbs](naq-pos/ADV) (_ǀguitsē_ "once") etc.

Word tokens consisting of digits and (optionally) punctuation characters are generally considered cardinal numbers and tagged as `NUM`. This includes numeric date/time formats (_11:00_) and phone numbers.
