### Definition

A proper noun is a noun (or a nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object. Acronyms of proper names, such as _CIAs_ and _GDRs_, are also tagged as `PROPN`.

In Khoekhoe proper nouns are generally capitalized. Note that though the names of week days (_Mantaxtsēs, Denstaxtsēs_) and months (_ǃKhanni, ǃKhanǀgôab_) are written capitalized (similarly to English), they are not considered proper nouns.

### Examples

* _Saras, Amob_ (names)

* _Kaiǀaub, Tsoarongos_ (cities), _Germanyb, Englandi_ (countries)

* _CIAs, GDRs_ (abbriviations of organizations)
