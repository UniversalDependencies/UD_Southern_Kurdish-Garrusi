### Definition

Khoekhoe mostly have postpositions, with some preposition borrowed from Afrikaans. They occur after (postposition) or before (preposition) a complement composed of a noun, a pronoun, a larger noun phrase, or clause that functions as a noun phrase, and that form a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause.

Some postpositions in Khoekhoe take the form of fixed multiword expressions, e.g. _ams ai_ “near”, _soas_ǃnâ_ "instead of". The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use (_ams_ is [NOUN](naq-pos/NOUN), _ai_ is `ADP` etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.


### Examples

* _ǃnâ_ "in"

* _ǃoa_ "to"

* _ǃoagu_ "opposite"

* _rondom_ "around" (preposition borrowed from Afrikaans)
