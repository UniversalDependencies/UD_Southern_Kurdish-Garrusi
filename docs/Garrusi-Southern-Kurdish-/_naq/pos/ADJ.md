### Definition

Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes. They may also function as predicates, as in

_Hoan ge a ǃgâi._ "Everything is good."

Some words that could be seen as adjectives (and are tagged as such in other annotation schemes) have a different tag in UD. See [DET](naq-pos/DET) for determiners and [NUM](naq-pos/NUM) for cardinal numerals.

`ADJ` is also used for “proper adjectives” such as _Russiaǁî_ "Russian" (“proper” as in proper nouns, i.e., words that are derived from names but are adjectives rather than nouns).

In accord with the UD approach, adjectival ordinal numerals (e.g., _ǂguro_ "first", ǃnonaǁî "third)  are tagged as adjectives, although the traditional grammar classifies them as numerals.

In most cases, Khoekhoe adjectives do not inflect and do not have any features. However, when an adjective follows (and not precedes) a nominal it modifies, it has the same [Person](naq-feat/Person), [Gender](naq-feat/Gender), [Number](naq-feat/Number), and [Assoc](naq-feat/Assoc) as the nominal, and gets the [Case](naq-feat/Case) of the whole noun phrase (_ǃgâi khoeb - khoeb ǃgâib - ǃgâi khoeba - khoeb ǃgâiba_).
