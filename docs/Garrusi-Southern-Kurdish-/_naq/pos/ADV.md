### Definition

Adverbs are words that typically modify [verbs](naq-pos/VERB) for such categories as time, place, direction or manner. They may also modify [adjectives](naq-pos/ADJ), other adverbs (e.g., _kaisa ǀgaisa_ "very strong"), and nominals (e.g., _tsîn_ "also", as in _ǁîb tsîn ge ǃgâi._ "Also _he_ is good.").

Adverbs that modify nominals get [Case](naq-feat/Case) of the whole noun phrase (_ǁîb <b>tsîn</b> ge ǂû-a ge mā._ "**Also** _he_ gave food" - _ǁîb ge ǂû-i <b>tsîna</b> ge mā._ "He **also** gave _food_"), and some also duplicate the [Person](naq-feat/Person), [Gender](naq-feat/Gender), [Number](naq-feat/Number), and [Assoc](naq-feat/Assoc) of the nominal (_ǁîb <b>ǀguib</b> ge ǂû-i ge mā._ "**Only** he gave food." - _ǁîb ǀguib ge ǂû-i <b>ǀgui-a</b> ge mā._ "He **only** gave _food_.").

There is a closed subclass of pronominal adverbs that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly (e.g., _nēpa_ "here"); similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, relative, demonstrative etc.. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV` part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

* demonstrative adverbs: _nēpa_ "here", _ǁnāpa_ "there", _naupa_ "there (at a distance)"
