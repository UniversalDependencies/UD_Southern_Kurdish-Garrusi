### Definition

A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

Note that the `VERB` tag covers main verbs (_content verbs_) but it does not cover _auxiliary verbs_ (_sī, mâ_), for which there is the dedictaed [AUX](naq-pos/AUX) tag. The location and existence clauses use _hâ_ and negative local copula _ǀkhai_ are tagged as `VERB`, because they are used in the clause final location is typically occupied by verbs and not by auxiliaries.
Most modal verbs act similarly to regular verbs (e.g., _ǁkhā_ "be able" and _ǁoa_ "be unable"), thus they are tagged [VERB](naq-pos/VERB). The exception is _moet_ "must", borrowed from Afrikaans, is allways in the auxiliary position, therefore it is tagged [AUX](naq-pos/AUX).

Modal verbs may be considered VERB or AUX, depending on their behavior in the given language. Language-specific documentation should specify which verbs are tagged AUX in which contexts.

In Khoekhoe verbs do not inflect for TAM or person-number-gender. Verbs inflect only for [Voice](naq-feat/Voice), with the following suffixes: Applicative _-ba_, Passive _-he_, Reciprocal _-gu_, Reflexive _-sen_. Various combinations of those (or none) can be used on one verb.

### Examples

* _mî_ "tell"

* _mîba_ "tell to (someone)"

* _mîhe_ "(something) is told"

* _mîbahe_ "is told to (someone)"
