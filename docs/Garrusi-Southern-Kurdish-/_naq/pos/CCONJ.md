### Definition

A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them.

The coordinate conjunction _tamas ka i o_ "or" is fixed multiword expression. The component words are then still tagged according to their basic use (_tama_ is [PART](naq-pos/PART), _s_ is [PRON](naq-pos/PRON) etc.) and their status as multiword expressions are accounted for in the syntactic annotation.

For subordinating conjunctions, see [SCONJ](naq-pos/SCONJ).

### Examples

* _tsî_ "and"

* _tamas ka i o_, _of_ "or"

* _xawe_ "but"
