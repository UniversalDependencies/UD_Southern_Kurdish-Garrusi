### Definition

An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation. It typically expresses an emotional reaction, is not syntactically related to other accompanying expressions, and may include a combination of sounds not otherwise found in the language.

As a special case of interjections, we recognize backannels particles such as _mm_, _ah_, etc.

### Examples

* _ā, î, ja_ "yes"

* _hî-î, nee_ "no"

* _mîre_ "hello"

* _mm_, _mhm_, _ah_, _aha_

* _ok_
