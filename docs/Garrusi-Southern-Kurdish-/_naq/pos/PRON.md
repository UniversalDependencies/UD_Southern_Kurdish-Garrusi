### Definition

Pronouns are words that substitute for [nouns](naq-pos/NOUN) or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context. Pronouns under this definition function like nouns.

### Personal pronouns

These are [PronType](naq-feat/PronType)=`Prs`.

They are used either in the full form (without a dash, except for _ǁî-i_), or only the second part (e.g. _ta, ts_). Only the second part is used as the subject person-gender-number marker, as well as in possessive noun phrase, etc.

The nominative case is written outside of the brackets, whereas the accusative (oblique) case is the form which combines the first part (before the dash) with the second part as written in the brackets (e.g. _satsa_ for the second person masculine singular). If nothing is written in the brackets, the nominative and the accusative case forms are identical (e.g. _tita_ for the first person singular).
