Boolean feature of [pronouns](naq-pos/PRON) and [determiners](naq-pos/DET). It tells whether the word is possessive.


### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: it is possessive

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word is not possessive, the `Poss` feature will just not be mentioned in the FEAT column. (Which means that empty value has the No meaning).

#### Examples

* _âta, âts, âgu_  "my, your (masc. sing.), their (masc. plur.)" (pronouns: ownership appositives)

* _ti, sa_ "my, your (sing.)" (determiners: simple associative)
