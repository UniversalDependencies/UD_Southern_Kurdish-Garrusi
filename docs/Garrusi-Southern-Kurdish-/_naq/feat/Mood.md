In Khoekhoe, `Mood` is a feature of [auxiliaries](naq-pos/AUX_).


### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: declarative

Similar to the indicative mood, can be considered the default mood in Khoekhoe. Could be used in combination with the apprehensive _tā_ and the interrogative _i_. This value is used exclusively for the declarative auxiliary _ge_.

#### Examples

* _ǁîs <b>ge</b> ariba ra ǃao._ "She is afraid of the dog."

### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The speaker uses imperative to politely order or ask the addressee to do the action expressed by the verb. This value is used exclusively for the imperative auxiliary _re_. Unmarked orders and requests are less polite.

#### Examples

* _Kō <b>re</b>!_ "Look!"

### <a name="Prh">`Prh`</a>: prohibitive

The speaker uses prohibitive to order or ask the addressee _not_ to do the action of the verb. Often in combination with imperative auxiliary. This value is used exclusively for the prohibitive auxiliary _tā_.

#### Examples

* _<b>Tā</b> "Ti khoeb ge" ti mî re._ "Don't say "My guy.""

### <a name="App">`App`</a>: apprehensive

The speaker uses apprehensive to warn against the happening of the event. Could be used in combination with the declarative auxiliary. This value is used exclusively for the apprehensive auxiliary _tā_.

#### Examples

* _<b>Tā</b> i ge ǀgaisase nî ǀgamsa._ "It should not be too hot."

### <a name="Pot">`Pot`</a>: potential

The action of the clause is possible but not certain. In Khoekhoe, there is no distinction between potential and conditional. This value is used for the potential auxiliary _ga/ka_ and potential imperfect auxiliary _kara/gara_.

#### Examples

* _ǃGûb <b>ga</b> o, ota ge nî ǃgû._ "If he goes, I will go"

* _Tita ge nē xū-e <b>gara</b> dī o, o ta ge huiba nî ǂhâ._ "If I do this, I'm going to need your help."

### <a name="Int">`Int`</a>: interrogative

The speaker may use interrogative in yes-not questions. This value is used for the interrogative auxiliary _i_, and the emphatic interrogative _kha_.

#### Examples

* _ǁNâuǃā <b>i</b>ts ra?_ "Do you understand?"

* _ǂÛb <b>kha</b> ge ǁîba ǁgan-e?_ "Did he eat the meat?"

### <a name="Ass">`Ass`</a>: assertive

The speaker uses assertive to state the action of the clause, when they believe that the addressee thinks otherwise. This value is used exclusively for the multi-word assertive auxiliary _kom … o_.

#### Examples

* _Tita <b>kom</b> ra hî<b>o</b>._ "I am (certainly) doing."
