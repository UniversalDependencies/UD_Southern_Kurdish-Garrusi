In Khoekhoe, `Tense` is a feature of [auxiliaries](naq-pos/AUX). It specifies the time when the action took / takes / will take place, in relation to the current moment or to another action in the utterance.


### <a name="Pres">`Pres`</a>: present tense
The present tense denotes actions that are in progress (or states that are valid) in a reference point; it may also describe events that usually happen. In the prototypical case, the reference point is the moment of producing the utterance. The only auxiliary that takes this value is the present copula _a_, and the present stative particle _a_.

#### Examples

* _Mâsa kha <b>a</b> ti ǀhawi?_ "What is then my fault?"
* _Sida ge Fransfonteinsa kaise <b>a</b> ǀnam._ "We love Fransfontein very much."

### <a name="Fut">`Fut`</a>: future tense
The future tense denotes actions that will happen after a reference point. In the prototypical case, the reference point is the moment of producing the sentence. This includes three auxiliaries: the future auxiliary _nî_, the imperfective future auxiliary _nîra_, and the negative future auxiliary _tide_.

#### Examples

* _Sîsenaon ǀaǁaeb ǃna ǃhoroba <b>nî</b> ǃgao._ "The workers will cut the mais soon."
* _Amase mûǃāsa a ǃkhaes ge Amob ǀguitsē kaise nîra gā-aisa._ "It is very clear that one day Amos will be very clever."
* _Amasets ǂgom te <b>tide</b>…_ "You will not believe…"

### <a name="Past">`Past`</a>: past tense
The past tense denotes actions that happened long time before a reference point; in the prototypical case, the reference point is the moment of producing the utterance. This includes two auxiliaries: the past auxiliary _ge_ and the imperfective past auxiliary _gere_.

#### Examples

* _ǃKhōb di tsaudi hoadi ge <b>ge</b> ǃkhoro._ "All the wells of Witrand dried up."
* _ǀGôaron ge ǂkhōnxūna ǂhûihe tsî kaise <b>gere</b> ǃgâiaǂgao._ "The young children were given sweets and they were very happy."


### <a name="RecPast">`RecPast`</a>: recent past tense
The recent past tense denotes actions that happened short time before a reference point, often on the same day or the day before; in the prototypical case, the reference point is the moment of producing the utterance. This includes two auxiliaries: the recent past auxiliary _go_ and the imperfective recent past auxiliary _goro_.

#### Examples

* _ǀGoan di daoǁaeb ge <b>go</b> hā._ "The time to brand small stock has come."
* _ǀǁAnǃoe da ge ǂhuwiba omde xu ǃgāsase <b>goro</b> mû._ "Yesterday evening we could see the fire clearly from our houses."
