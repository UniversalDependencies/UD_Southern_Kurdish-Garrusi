In Khoekhoe, PronType is a feature of [pronouns](naq-pos/PRON), [determiners](naq-pos/DET) and pronominal [adverbs](naq-pos/ADV)


### <a name="Prs">`Prs`</a>: personal or possessive personal pronoun or determiner

See also the [Poss](https://universaldependencies.org/cs/feat/Poss.html) feature that distinguishes normal personal pronouns from possessives. Note that it is not a full list, since the paradigms of personal and possessive pronouns is more extensive. Please see [Case](naq-feat/Case), [Gender](naq-feat/Gender), [Number](naq-feat/Number), and [Person](naq-feat/Person) features.

* _ta, ts, b, s, i, da, du, n_ "I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they" (subject clitics)

* _te, tsi, bi, si, i, da, du, ni/in_ "me, us, you, you, him, her, it, them"
