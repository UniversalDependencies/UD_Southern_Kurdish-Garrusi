Evidentiality is the morphological marking of a speaker’s source of information. Khoekhoe has a marking only for non-first-hand evidentiality, whereas first-hand evidentiality is unmarked.

In Khoekhoe it is an [auxiliary](naq-pos/AUX_) feature, used for the auxiliary _koma_.

### <a name="Nfh">`Nfh`</a>: non-firsthand
Note that there is no `No` value. If the clause does not have a non-first-hand evidential auxiliary, the `Nfh` feature will not be mentioned in the FEAT column. (Which means that empty values have the `No` meaning.)

#### Examples

* _Aob ge koma a ǃgâi._ "The man is supposedly good."
