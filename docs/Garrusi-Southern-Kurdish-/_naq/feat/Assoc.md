In Khoekhoe, `Assoc` is a boolean feature of nominals: [nouns](naq-pos/NOUN), [proper nouns](naq-pos/PROPN), and [pronouns](naq-pos/PRON). It is also an inflectional feature of other parts of speech ([adjectives](naq-pos/ADJ), [determiners](naq-pos/ADV)), and [adverbs](naq-pos/DET)) that mark agreement with the head nominals when they follow them, and of [numerals](naq-pos/NUM) that may function as nominals. The feature tells whether the nominal appears in the associative plural form, which denotes constructions such as ‘X and such, X and others associated with X’. The associative plural is marked with the suffix _-hâ_. `Assoc` combines with either [Number](naq-feat/Number)=Dual or [Number](naq-feat/Number)=Plur

### <a name="Yes">`Yes`</a>: associative plural

Note that there is no `No` value. If the word does not have the associative plural morpheme _-hâ_, the `Assoc` feature will just not be mentioned in the FEAT column (which means that empty value has the `No` meaning).

#### Examples

* _saruhân_ "cigarettes and other things (associated with smoking)"

* _Adeledhân_ "Adelaide and the others (who live with her)"

* _ǁnāhâra_ "that one and his companion"
