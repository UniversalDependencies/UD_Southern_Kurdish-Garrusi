# Relation Subtypes in the Data

In addition to the universal dependency taxonomy, it is desirable to recognize grammatical relations that are particular to one language or a small group of related languages.
Such language-specific relations are necessary to accurately capture the genius of a particular language but will not involve concepts that generalize broadly.
These language-specific relations should always be regarded as a subtype of an existing UD relation.

Labels of language-specific relations explictly encode the core UD relation that the language-specific relation is a subtype of, following the format *universal:extension*.

This is an automatically generated list of relation subtypes that occur in the UD data.
