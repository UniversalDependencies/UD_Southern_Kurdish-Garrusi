This relation is a subtype of the obl relation that applies
when an oblique takes the form of a nominal lacking a preposition
(a.k.a. a noun phrase). It is "unmarked" in that, unlike most obliques,
it has no adposition.

Examples include:

~~~ sdparse
Þis ærend-ƿrit is fram Petere and hit ƿæs ȝebroht ȝierstan-dæg . \n This letter is from Peter and it was brought yesterday.
obl:unmarked(ȝebroht, ȝierstan-dæg)
