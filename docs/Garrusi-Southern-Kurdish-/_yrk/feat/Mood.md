Mood is a feature that expresses modality and subclassifies finite [verb](myv-pos/VERB) forms.


### <a name="Appr">`Appr`</a>: apprehensive

The core meaning of the apprehensive is fear about the future.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _<b>ни-рва-дм</b> пуда_ "If only I wouldn’t be late!"


### <a name="Aprx">`Aprx`</a>: approximative

The approximative expresses the meaning ‘it seems, it looks like’ and basically denotes a higher degree of certainty than, e.g., the probabilitative, because the situation is either witnessed by the speaker directly or is familiar to her from previous experience.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _нохомʼ <b>хада-нараха</b>_ "It looks that he killed a polar fox"


### <a name="Dub">`Dub`</a>: Dubitative

The dubitative has a variety of epistemic meanings including uncertainty, doubts and possibility. In some instances it indicates the inference that the event is bound to occur.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _тирта ӈано <b>то-ванӈкабя</b>_ "The plane will probably arrive."


### <a name="Hort">`Hort`</a>: hortative

The hortative only exists in the 1st person, and used to express exhortations to the 1st person.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _маньʼ тюкум <b>хана-ха-дмʼ</b>_ "_<b>Let me take</b> this_"


### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperative

The imperative only exists in the 2nd person.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _ты <b>хадаˮ</b>_ "_<b>kill</b> a reindeer_"

### <a name="Ind">`Ind`</a>: indicative

The indicative is the default mood, it is unmarked in Tundra Nenets.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _маньʼ <b>хонара-дмʼ</b>_ "I have fallen asleep."


### <a name="Infr">`Infr`</a>: inferential

The inferential mood conveys a large variety of evidential meanings. It often denotes the events which cannot be witnessed directly.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _пухуцяда едмʼ мале пире-ви_ "The old woman had already boiled the kettle"


### <a name= "Int">`Int`</a>: interrogative

The interrogative mood is used in all types of questions. The interrogative only has past tense reference.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _пыдар <b>хонара-са-нʼ</b>?_ "Did you fall asleep?"


### <a name="Jus">`Jus`</a>: jussive

A directive mood only having 3rd person forms.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _хаёя_ "let him stay"



### <a name="Nec">`Nec`</a>: necessative

The 1st and 3rd person necessitative conveys expectation, some degree of certainty about a future event (‘should’), or deontic obligation. The 2nd person is close to permissive.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _мякани <b>пя-бцу-вʼ</b>_ "I should go home"


### <a name="Pot">`Pot`</a>: potential

The 1st person potential expresses a promise about a future event, the 2nd person potential conveys hope.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _ситʼ маркана <b>хо-бцаке-дмʼ</b>_ "I'll try to find you in the city"


### <a name="Prob">`Prob`</a>: probabilitative

The probabilitative expresses probability. The speaker is not certain about the reality of the described event but makes a guess, often based on inference.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _нянаʼ <b>пэда-вэкэн</b>_ "You must have become very tired"


### <a name="Rep">`Rep`</a>: reportative

It conveys an unwitnessed event usually known from hearsay.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _мань <b>хонара-рахавев</b>!_ "I must have fallen asleep!"

### <a name="Reput">`Reput`</a>: reputative

The reputative mood expresses some kind of irrealis comparision (‘as if’), or low probability.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _нисями нгавэн <b>то-вна</b>_ "My father is unlikely to come"

### <a name="Sub">`Sub`</a>: subjunctive

The 1st person subjunctive expresses a promise (often one which the speaker does not seriously intend to keep) or agreement, often involuntary, to perform the action. The 2nd person subjunctive is directive but it is more polite or more remote imperative.

#### Examples

* [yrk] _книга-мʼ <b>темда-и-дмʼ</b>_ "I will buy the book (leave me in peace!)"
