The `Voice` feature applies to [VERB](_ka/pos/VERB).

### <a name="Act">`Act`</a>: active and autoactive voices

The subject of the verb is the doer of the action (agent), the object is affected by the action (patient). This label is also used for the autoactive voice, when the subject of the verb is the agent and the patient of the action.

#### Examples

* _ბავშვი <b>ხატავს</b> სურათს._ 'A child draws a picture.'

### <a name="Mid">`Mid`</a>: inactive and mediopassive voices

The subject of the verb is medially affected by the action.

#### Examples

* _ქალს <b>ჰქვია</b> თამარი._ 'The woman's name is Tamar.'

### <a name="Pass">`Pass`</a>: passive voice

The subject of the verb is affected by the action (patient). The doer (agent) is either unexpressed or it appears as an oblique dependent or an object of the verb. 

#### Examples

* _ბავშვი <b>დაიბადა</b> ჯანმრთელი._ 'The child has been born healthy.'

### <a name="Cau">`Cau`</a>: causative voice

Marks the causative alteration of verb forms.

#### Examples

* _ფულს <b>გაგაკეთებინებ</b>._ 'I will make you earn money.'

### <a name="Inv">`Inv`</a>: inverted voice

Used for two-place verba sentiendi and similar verbs, in which the experiencer (agent) is marked with the Dative case and receives the `nsubj` relation, whereas the patient/recipient is marked with the Nominative and receives the `obj` relation (inverted syntax). Those verbs often translate to transitive constructions in other langues (‘X has/likes/hears Y’), but are not prototypically transitive. In Tschenkéli’s classification, those verbs are ‘Inverted verbs’ (class IV).

#### Examples

* _გოგონას დედა <b>უყვარს</b>._ 'The little girl loves her mother.'
