`Aspect` is a feature that specifies the duration of an action in time and whether the action has been completed. 
In the Naga-Suansu corpus, aspect is typically a feature of verbs ([VERB]()), but it is also used with the verbal auxiliary ([AUX]()) _la_ "be", adpositions ([ADP]()), adverbs ([ADV]()) when they act as phrasal verb particles (with the [compound:prt]() dependency), and verbal nouns ([NOUN]() with [VerbForm]()=`Vnoun`).



### <a name="Imp">`Imp`</a>: imperfect

The action took / takes / will take some time span and there is no information whether and when it was / will be completed.

#### Examples

* _Leneonan ba baszuela letter <b>rakke</b>._ "The girl **wrote** a letter the her friend."

* _A kehu bag khanika <b>manung le</b>._ "I **want** two bags of millet."

### <a name="Perf">`Perf`</a>: perfect

The action has been / will have been completed. In Naga-Suansu, this distinction is expressed via the marker **te**.

#### Examples

* _Peter lhung <b>fiate</b>._ "Peter **threw** a stone."

### <a name="Prog">`Prog`</a>: progressive

Naga-Suansu progressive aspect is constructed via the simultaneous converb *ganan* after the main verb and the auxiliary _la_, that takes the relevant [Tense]() marking.

#### Examples

* _Rhui <b>tra ganan laile</b>._ "The house **is burning**."
