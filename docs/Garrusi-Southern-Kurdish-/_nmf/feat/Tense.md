Tense is a feature that specifies the time when the action took / takes / will take place, in relation to a reference point. The reference is often the moment of producing the sentence, but it can be also another event in the context. 

In the corpus, tense can appear on verbs ([VERB]()), the verbal auxiliaries ([AUX]()), and, in phrasal verb particles, postpositions ([ADP]()) and adverbs ([ADV]()).


### <a name="Pres">`Pres`</a>: present

The present tense denotes actions that are in progress (or states that are valid) in a reference point. In Naga-Suansu, the marker _le_ is used to mark actions and events that are valid at the current reference point, without any specification on their progression or conclusion. The marker _le_ is not used for realized and complete events that belong to the past and states or events that have not happened or are projected to happen in the future.

#### Examples

* _Miszu puidungre India nahn <b>bathale</b>_ "Many peoples **live** in India." 



### <a name="Past">`Past`</a>: past

The past tense denotes actions that happened before a reference point.
In Naga-Suansu, the past form is expressed via the morpheme _-e_ or by the base form of the verb depending on the phonological properties of the verb stem.

#### Examples

* _Bai ashu bai the <b>thaie</b>_ "She/he **saw** her/his mother yesterday." 

* _Bu <b>re</b>_ "They **came**." 



### <a name="Pqp">`Pqp`</a>: pluperfect

The pluperfect denotes action that happened before another action in past (it is not used for temporal clauses denoting successive events). In Naga-Suansu, this tense is expressed via the marker _-ha_. This form can also be used to describe established and immutable properties grounded in reality. 

#### Examples

* _Khaliuh jaa kathie majaa rue bu di <b>chokla ha</b> matamda_ "The thieves cursed each other when **they were arrested**."

* _Hai khap gase di mari da <b>sam ha</b>_ "This hook is **made** of iron."
