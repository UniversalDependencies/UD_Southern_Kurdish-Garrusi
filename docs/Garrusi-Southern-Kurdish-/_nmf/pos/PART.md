### Definition

`Particles` are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech. Particles may encode grammatical categories such as negation. Particles are normally not inflected, although exceptions may occur.
 
### Examples

* Negation particles: _garhe_, _khama_
* Reportative particles after quotes and labels: _re_, _reha_
* Discourse particles: _la_ (contrastive)
