### Definition

`Adjectives` are words that typically modify [nouns](nmf-pos/NOUN) and specify their properties or attributes. 
In Naga-Suansu, most adjectives are derived from [verbs](nmf-pos/VERB). 
They follow [nouns](nmf-pos/NOUN), for example _Peter <b>za tra</b> mohn mule_ ("Peter likes hot tea") and they can be used predicatively, where they behave like verbs, carrying tense and aspect values (_za <b>trale</b>_, "the tea is hot"). When adjectives modify nouns, they take [Case]() and [Number]() markers as these occur at the end of the NP.

Proper adjectives, such as _American_, are tagged as `ADJ` rather than [PROPN]().

### Examples

* _tra_ "hot"

* _katha_ "new"

* _gaszu_ "beautiful"

* _American_ "American"

* _gari kathapha_ "new cars"
