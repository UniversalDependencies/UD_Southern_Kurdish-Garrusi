### Definition

A `verb` is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause.

In the Naga-Suansu treebank we distinguish between content verbs and auxiliaries [AUX](). There is one verbal auxiliary _la_ "be", tagged as [AUX]().

Naga-Suansu verbs do not take person nor number agreement: _A/Bu thale_ "I/They know".

Verbal nouns (e.g. _rung<b>e</b>_ "say-NMLZ" (the saying)) are tagged as [NOUN]().
### Examples

* _tha_ "to know" - infinite

* _thale_ "know(s)", _thae_ "knew", _thaate_ "have known" - finite

* _thaganan (la)_ "(is) knowing" - converb
