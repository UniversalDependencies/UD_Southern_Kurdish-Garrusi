### Definition

`Adverbs` are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as place, time, or manner. They may also modify [adjectives](nmf-pos/ADJ) and other adverbs, as in _bathanahn	thokke_ "very serious".

There is a closed subclass of pronominal adverbs that refer to circumstances in context, rather than naming them directly; similarly to pronouns, these can be categorized as interrogative, demonstrative etc. Pronominal adverbs also get the `ADV` part-of-speech tag but they are differentiated by additional features.

In Naga-Suansu, some adverbs can also function as verbal particles, e.g. _fi <b>lhi</b>a_ "dropped **down**".

### Examples

* _bathanahn_ "very"
* _athwenan_ "now"
* _lhi_ "down"
* _daichu_ "only"
* demonstrative adverbs: _hano_ "here", _dino_ "there"
* interrogative adverbs: _gare_ "how", _mwetheda_ "why", _kunahn_ "where"
