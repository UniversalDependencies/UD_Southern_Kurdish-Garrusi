### Definition

`Pronouns` are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context.

Pronouns under this definition function like nouns. Note that some languages traditionally extend the term pronoun to words that substitute for adjectives. Such words are not tagged `PRON` under our universal scheme. They are tagged as determiners in order to annotate the same thing the same way across languages.

### Examples

* Personal pronouns: _a_ "I", _nahn_ "you (sg.)", _ba_ "he/she/it", _hai_ "we", _na_ "you (pl.)", _bu_ "they"
* Demonstrative pronouns: _hadi_, _hai_ "this", _didi_, _tye_ "that"
* Interrogative pronouns: _mwethe_, _mwa_ "what", _thuza_ "who" 
* Indefinite pronouns: _chatha_ "others"
* Total pronouns: _mazohn_ "all"
