### Definition

An `Auxiliary` of a clause is a function word associated with a verbal predicate that expresses categories such as tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality. It is often a verb (which may have non-auxiliary uses as well). The most common auxiliary in the Naga Naga-Suansu corpus is the existential <b>la</b> "to be", "to exist". Naga-Suansu has a copula, <b>e</b> used in identity predication in the present tense.

### Examples

* Mood auxiliaries: _ra_ (imperative), _ga_ (hortative), _dai_ (jussive), _la_ (interrogative), _rahn_ (irrealis)

* Modal auxiliary _geraha_ (obligatory)

* Evidentiality auxiliaries: _gu_ (first-hand) and _ga_ (non first-hand)

* Verbal auxiliary: _Tye baneonan khorohndi khamganan <b>la</b>le_ "The man is closing the door"

* Verbal copula: _A Jason <b>e</b>_ "I am Jason"
