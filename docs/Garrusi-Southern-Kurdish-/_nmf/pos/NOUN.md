### Definition

`Nouns` are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea.

The `NOUN` tag is intended for common nouns only. See [PROPN]() for proper nouns and [PRON]() for pronouns.

[Gender]() is not a category in Naga-Suansu. There are remnants of gender specification on two nouns, _baneo_ "boy" and _leneo_ "girl". Given the exceptionality of these forms, we code the tokens as two distinct lemmas without including gender marking.

Nouns inflect for [Number]() (zero marked singular and overt plural) and [Case]().

Nominalization is a very productive process in Naga-Suansu. Verbal nominalization with _-e_ and _-pha_ produce nouns (with [VerbForm]()=`Vnoun` and [Aspect]() feature), e.g. _rung<b>e</b>_ "say-NMLZ" (the saying). Clitic _=di_ is a clausal nominalizer, see [SCONJ]().

### Examples

* _baneo_ "boy"

* _hui_ "dog"

* _lairak_ "book"
